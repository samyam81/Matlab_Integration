# Calculator Application with MATLAB Integration

## Overview
This project provides a simple calculator application implemented in both Java and C#. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, it integrates with MATLAB for handling division operations.

## Features
- User input for selecting the operation and providing operands.
- Calculation of arithmetic operations directly in Java (for the Java version).
- Utilization of MATLAB for division operations (for the C# version).
- Error handling for invalid input and exceptions.

## Prerequisites
- **Java Version:**
  - Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
  - MATLAB installed and configured correctly.
- **C# Version:**
  - MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) installed and configured correctly.
  
## Setup and Usage

### Java Version
1. Compile the Java code using any Java compiler.
2. Ensure that MATLAB is installed and configured correctly on your system.
3. Run the compiled Java application.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform arithmetic operations.

### C# Version
1. Ensure that MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) is installed and configured correctly on your system.
2. Compile the C# code using any C# compiler.
3. Run the compiled C# application.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform arithmetic operations.
